# Random-Code-Projects
This respoitory is a compilation of projects I have done to better my capabilities in programming.

Projects include:
  - Cat Classifier
  - Card GANs
  - Blob detection of a magnetic pendulum
  - Cat detector
  - A program that can play Mario Kart by itself
  - More in progress (Cool Raspberry Pi ML Projects, Autoencoders, etc.)!
  - Even more to come!


All data to replicate any of these projects is available either by having the data as seperate file in the repository or via downloading from the google drive within the code itself.

Any applications needed to replicate a certain project will have an guide on how to download them and how to use them in the documentation of the project folder.
